# Student Grade Management System


## Overview
The Student Grade Management System is a web-based application designed to manage student records, grades, and associated modules. It features a multi-level architecture, with a JavaScript and CSS frontend and a Spring Boot backend powered by a H2 in-memory SQL database.

## Features
Backend: Spring Boot framework with Maven for dependency management and H2 database integration.
Data Flow: Implements CRUD operations and REST APIs to handle requests from the frontend, process them in the backend, and return data for display.
CI/CD Pipeline: Fully integrated with GitLab for continuous integration, ensuring quality and bug-free deployments.
Database Model
The systemâ€™s database is logically modeled with relations between entities such as Students, Grades, Modules, and Registration. These objects are instantiated within the Spring framework and mapped directly to the H2 database.

## Technical Highlights
CRUD Operations: Example endpoints include:
GET /students - Fetch student records.
POST /grades - Add a grade with dependency injection for related modules and students.
CI/CD Deployment: Automated builds and tests through a robust GitLab pipeline.
Challenges and Solutions
Mapping Errors: Resolved by redefining relationships and introducing proper variables for module references.
System Refactor: Reworked system architecture to correct aggregation issues between entities.
CI/CD Configuration: Fixed build configurations to align with updated project requirements.

## Retrospective
Successes: Improved understanding of Spring Boot, Maven, GitLab, and software engineering concepts.
Challenges: Faced and overcame significant refactoring and setup hurdles.
Future Development: Plans include adding authentication, login features, and extending registration capabilities.

## Conclusion
This project has been a valuable learning experience in building, deploying, and maintaining a full-stack application. It provided insights into real-world software engineering practices and reinforced key technical skills.
